# Anthropomorphic_CHD_Bivariate_Scans
Spring 2018 Rotation project in the Voight lab. Performing bivariate scans on anthropomorphic traits and coronary heart dissease
My lab notebook and a summary of the experiments performed in this project are all available on this repository (Note: the summary references line numbers in my lab notebook where commands and example output can be found). The Versions_of_Bivariate_Scan file is a brief description of the different versions of the bivariate scan code that are run in these experiments.
