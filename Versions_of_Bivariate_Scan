Versions of the bivariate scan script used in this project:

Generic – This is the original version provided to me by Katie Siewert. Uses independent SNPs via a plink command to estimate the χ2 parameters for the bivariate scan H0 distribution. Each SNP that was in both trait summary statistic files is then tested to see if the trait/genotype distribution is significantly different from the expected H0 distribution. This χ22 goodness of fit test returns a final output all SNPs that are have a genome wide significant bivariate p-value or near genome wide significant bivariate p-value. It filters away any SNPs that have been previously associated with (or are in LD with an associated SNP) with either of the trait. This script can be found on the LPC at /project/voight_GWAS/wbone/bivariate_scan_project/code/Bivar_Script_generalized.R. The exact code run for each analysis can be found in the analysis directory.

All_SNPs – This version of the bivariate scan script does not filter out any SNPs (other than the requirement that each SNP is in both single trait GWAS summary statistic files) to estimate the χ2 parameters for the bivariate scan H0 distribution. This script can be found on the LPC at /project/voight_GWAS/wbone/bivariate_scan_project/code/Bivar_Script_generalized_all_SNPs_for_var.R. The exact code run for each analysis can be found in the analysis directory.

Var_harm_out_is1 – This version of the bivariate scan script replaces the variance of the outcome trait used for harmonization step with a 1 in the variance/covariance matrix (for our purposes this was always the anthropomorphic trait, but would do the same for any trait put in the outcome trait position in the config.R file). NOTE: The covariance of the two traits WILL NOT be adjusted to reflect the variance being adjusted to 1. This script can be found on the LPC at /project/voight_GWAS/wbone/bivariate_scan_project/code/Bivar_Script_generalized_var_trait1_is1.R. The exact code run for each analysis can be found in the analysis directory.

Transform_var_harm_out – This version of the bivariate scan script transforms the outcome trait used for harmonization step to make sure the z-scores of the trait are standard normal. This makes it so the variance in the variance/covariance matrix of the trait is 1 and the covariance has been updated to reflect this trait’s Z-scores being standardized. This script can be found on the LPC at /project/voight_GWAS/wbone/bivariate_scan_project/code/Bivar_Script_generalized_transform_var_harm_out.R. The exact code run for each analysis can be found in the analysis directory.

Transform_var_both – This version of the bivariate scan script transforms the both traits used  to make sure the z-scores of the trait are standard normal. This makes the variance in the variance/covariance matrix of both traits 1 and the covariance has been updated to reflect the traits’ Z-scores being standardized. This script can be found on the LPC at /project/voight_GWAS/wbone/bivariate_scan_project/code/Bivar_Script_generalized_transform_both_var.R. The exact code run for each analysis can be found in the analysis directory.
